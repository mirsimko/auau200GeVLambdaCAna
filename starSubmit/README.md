Submitting script that uses a hack for star-submit
==================================================

To use this script, you have to link the `submitPicoHFMaker.xml`, `compileTest.C`, and `parseFileList.csh` from the
[`auau200GeVRun14and16`](https://github.com/mirsimko/auau200GeVRun14and16/tree/run16/starSubmit)
repository into the `starSubmit` folder.
